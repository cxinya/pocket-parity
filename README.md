# Pocket Parity

As the Managing Director of Data Analytics & Measurement at Flamboyan Foundation, I routinely leverage R and R Markdown to analyze and report data of diverse shapes, sizes, and sources. However, I am unable to share samples of my recent professional code because data and methods are proprietary or otherwise protected. Instead, I created new visualizations to highlight an issue that plagues many women: **our pockets are simply too small.**

Check out my deep dive into this problem [here](https://cxinya.github.io/pocket-parity/).
