# Pocket Parity

As the Director of Research & Data Analysis at the Physician Assistant Education Assocation, I routinely leverage R and R Markdown to analyze and report data of diverse shapes, sizes, and sources. However, I am unable to share samples of my recent professional code because data and methods are proprietary or otherwise protected. Instead, I created new visualizations to highlight an issue that plagues many women: **our pockets are simply too small.**
